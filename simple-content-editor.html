<p>Here is some blog-post content. This is some <em>emphasized text</em> - also known as 'italic' in this editor. Here is some text with <strong>strong emphasis</strong> - which is usually shown with a <em><strong>bold</strong></em> look. This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined</span>.</p>
<p>Here is another paragraph. It's a short paragraph but it has <a href="https://conspireagency.com/" target="_blank" title="Link to Conspire Agency website." rel="noopener noreferrer">a link</a>.</p>

<h2>This is a level 2 heading.</h2>
<p>No one should use any 'color' in this editor. Color should be taken care of by theme's programming. If you feel a need to use color, please talk to the theme developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an <em>unordered</em> list.</li>
<li>Here is some text with <strong>strong emphasis</strong> - which is usually shown with a <em>bold</em> look.</li>
<li>Here is another list item. It's short <em>but</em> it has <a href="https://conspireagency.com/" target="_blank" title="Link to Conspire Agency website." rel="noopener noreferrer">a link</a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It's kinda sneaky... but there is a text formatting option above that looks like <strong>A v. </strong>Inside that thing there are headings - and at the bottom, there a blockquote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use the blockquote to style things as a call-out. It looks like this / which just indents it a little - but on the actual website it will be styled appropriately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, it's a little tricky to get out of it.</p>
<h2>This is a level 2 heading.</h2>
<p>The page title / or 'article' title is already the level 1 heading, so there is no need to use it. It's unlikely that you'll need level 3 and so on.</p>

<li>Here is some text with<span> </span><strong>strong emphasis</strong><span> </span>- which is usually shown with a<span> </span><em>bold</em><span> </span>look.</li>
<li>Here is another<span> </span>list item. It's short<span> </span><em>but</em><span> </span>it has <a href="https://conspireagency.com/" target="_blank" title="Link to Conspire Agency website." rel="noopener noreferrer">a link</a><span>.</span></li>

<p>It might not look to pretty in the editor, but it will look nice on the website. It's important to use the right formatting so that the search engines can crawl your content and lead people to your store. : )</p>
